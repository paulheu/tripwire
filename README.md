# README

Some things have changed, read carefully - also Docker has some isssues yet, recommend not using it or helping solve the issues.

The landing page twitter feed won't work since the one I used requires a private token, I will have to find a new way to do it later.


### Tripwire - EVE Online wormhole mapping web tool

- MIT license
- [Learn Markdown](https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo)

### Setup guide for Linux

Requirements:

- PHP7+ (older requires polyfill for public/login.php as documented in that file)
- php-mbstring must be installed
- MySQL (or some flavor of MySQL - needed because database EVENTS)
- A my.cnf MySQL config file example is located in `.docker/mysql/my.cnf`
- The `sql_mode` and `event_scheduler` my.cnf lines are important, make sure you have them in your my.cnf file & reboot MySQL
- CRON or some other scheduler to execute PHP scripts

Setup:

- Create a `tripwire` database using the export located in `.docker/mysql/tripwire.sql`
- For development: create an EVE dump database, define it's name later in `config.php`. Download from: https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/ To download the latest use the following link: https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/mysql-latest.tar.bz2. You do not need a copy of the SDE to run Tripwire (since 1.21).
- Clone the Tripwire repo to where you are going to serve to the public OR manually download repo and copy files yourself
- Copy `db.inc.example.php` to `db.inc.php` - modify file per your setup
- Copy `config.example.php` to `config.php` - modify file per your setup
- Create an EVE developer application via https://developers.eveonline.com/applications
- EVE SSO `Callback URL` should be: `https://your-domain.com/index.php?mode=sso`
- Use the following scopes:
  esi-location.read_location.v1
  esi-location.read_ship_type.v1
  esi-ui.open_window.v1
  esi-ui.write_waypoint.v1
  esi-characters.read_corporation_roles.v1
  esi-location.read_online.v1
  esi-characters.read_titles.v1
  esi-search.search_structures.v1
- Settings go in the `config.php` file
- Modify your web server to serve Tripwire from the `tripwire/public` folder so the files like `config.php` and `db.inc.php` are not accessible via URL
- Setup a CRON or schedule for `system_activity.cron.php` to run at the top of every hour. CRON: `0 * * * * php /dir/to/system_activity.cron.php`
- Setup a CRON or schedule for `account_update.cron.php` to run every 3 minutes or however often you want to check for corporation changes. CRON: `*/3 * * * * php /dir/to/account_update.cron.php`
- If you are using SELinux: Tripwire needs access to the 'cache' directory inside the deployment directory, usually /var/www/tripwire. You need to make this a write-access directory via SELinux labelling: `semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t "/var/www/tripwire/cache(/.*)?"` - then relabel the directory `restorecon -R -v /var/www/tripwire`

### Setup guide for Docker
- Install Docker for your environment: https://www.docker.com/
- Setup Developer application on Eve developers
- Configure your domain registrar with a record pointed to the vm you are using -- ensure port 80/443 are open (80 can be closed after traefik setup)
- Clone repo and change directory into it
- Copy db.inc.docker.example.php to db.inc.php
- Copy config.example.php to config.php
- Modify the constants with your own settings in both files
- Prep traefik acme file


**SSO**
```
  - Create an EVE developer application via https://developers.eveonline.com/applications
  - EVE SSO `Callback URL` should be: `https://your-domain.com/index.php?mode=sso`
  - Use the following scopes:
    - esi-location.read_location.v1
    - esi-location.read_ship_type.v1
    - esi-ui.open_window.v1
    - esi-ui.write_waypoint.v1
    - esi-characters.read_corporation_roles.v1
    - esi-location.read_online.v1
    - esi-characters.read_titles.v1
    - esi-search.search_structures.v1
```

**docker-compose.yml**
edit the following items with your information
```
under Traefik:
  - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.email=your@email.com"

under nginx
  - "traefik.http.routers.nginx.rule=Host(`your domain`)"
  - "traefik.http.routers.nginxweb_http.rule=Host(`your domain`)"

under mysql
  - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="any root password you want, don't use quotes"
  - MYSQL_USER="any non root user you want, also no quotes"
  - MYSQL_PASSWORD="any non root password you want, still no quotes"

under db-seed
  - DB_ROOT_PASS=the same ROOT password as under sql
```

**db.inc.php**
```
  - `host=` should be `mysql`
  - `dbname=` should be `tripwire_database`
  - `update `username` and `password` with the user name and password from docker-compose.yml
```

**config.php**
```
  - `EVE_DUMP` matches SDE_DB in docker-compose
  - `CDN_DOMAIN` this should match the domain name in your docker-compose
  - `EVE_SSO_CLIENT`, `EVE_SSO_SECRET`, and `EVE_SSO_REDIRECT` should be updated to match the EVE SSO application
```

**Traefik Acme**
```
mkdir -p traefik-data
touch traefik-data/acme.json
chmod 600 traefik-data/acme.json
```

**CRON**
```
crontab -l | cat - crontab-tw.txt >/tmp/crontab.txt && crontab /tmp/crontab.txt
```


**General**

A quick and dirty setup script is provided `./setup.sh`

To view logs in real time run `docker compose logs -f`

To start the stack run `docker compose up -d --build`
